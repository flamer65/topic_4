            <p>Analysing vast amount of data recevied from different linked sensors. were as with the help of A.I and M.L we can create different services and solutions. were as we can get smart security, connectivity, integration, Automation, Scaling, sensing
                and many more features from IOT based applictions. implementing in healthcare sector, smart home, online shopping, Google home
            </p>

            <h1 class="d">Smart Buidling</h1>
            <p class="b">Smart building, what do we understand by smart building, lets have example of Considering Schiphol an autonomous airport in Netherlands. It features with no human attendent present, whole system with A.I and M.L passangers have to arrive 16
                mins earlier before the flight take off. security system integrators advise the airport on technical issues, provide and install solutions, and carry out maintenance and repair work. Intelligent cameras for crowd checking and foot count.
                Weather forecast system. Integrated transactions management system. HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) based on time. This are the some of major parts playedby A.I and M.L IOT-application controling Airport.

            <h2>Control Interface</h2>
            <p class="c">
                Talking about control interface we have Different devices use different interfaces for example- TV remote has a user interface that consists of various buttons, and devices such as Amazon Echo can be controlled with voice commands.were as this display
                help in high level features like Display Hierarchy ,Contents of Displays ,Display Layout,Abbreviations and Labels ,Alarms Text Messages ,Lines and Arrows. the users like local residents,security officals, Guests, Shopkeepers and customers
                can usefor their daily purpose. making them comfortable use the Iot enabled devices. they will have easy interactions.
